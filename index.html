    <p>I'm Guatemalan but I was born in San Mateo and have lived in the East Bay since I was 3 years old.
    I'm grateful for living here because of the people I have met. Home isn't just the place I live, it's the people as well.
    My favorite color is purple, been standing strong on that since I was 14. It's kind of funny, San Francisco State was my first choice because I'm looking forward to wearing purple gowns when I graduate. I'm currently a 2nd year.
    I'm a commuter student and work a part-time job. I'm a Visual Communication Design major right now but I plan to go to a nursing program after graduting. </p>

    <em><B>FUN FACTS:</B></em> My favorite artists are Taylor Swift and Frank Ocean. I was able to go to the Eras Tour concert when she came to
    the Levi's stadium in Santa Clara. It was a great brithday gift. That was my first concert ever, it was nice to finally see her because I've liked her since I was a kid.
    I'm looking to go to more concerts but Sabrina Carpenter sold out so quick. My hobbies just consist of going to church or hanging out with my family, my boyfriend and an occasional Dress To Impress game.
    I really love cats, I have one of my own. He is a calico named Smooky. I live in a cat infested neighborhood too so my camera roll is just full of them.
    I have a scar on my right eyebrow from when my brother pushed me off a chair when I was 1 years old. It used to be really prominent when I was younger but now I'm too old.
    My birthday is June 21st. I do love summer, I think the heat is better than cold weather but thats just me.
