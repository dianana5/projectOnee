            <p> I love the elegant and sleek looks she provides with her fashion. I was drawn to her designing because of the meaning of the Orb.
                I love the Saturn symbol she uses. The article 'The Sun' states, "The Orb is supposed to symbolize the importance of the past while nodding towards the future. This could be viewed as a good way of describing Westwood's career, as she managed to evolve her style during her life in fashion".

        <p> I have recently been fascinated with their bags. The simplistic looks they create already gets me like "Wow I need that". They choose the most beautiful colors too.</p>

        <p> I would say I was basically born a Batman and Spiderman fan. Since I was a kid, I have always admired comic book art. I love specfically the way he draws Spiderman's suit.</p>
